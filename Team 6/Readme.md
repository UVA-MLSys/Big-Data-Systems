# Data
The data can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/state-farm-distracted-driver-detection/overview). The original dataset contains over 102 thousand images of drivers--some distracted, some not. To be able to run on local machines, a smaller subset of the data was used for model building and analysis.
