# Introduction

Data Scientists and analysts have developed several metrics for determining a player's value to their team's success. Prominent examples include Value Over Replacement Player (VORP), Box Plus/Minus (BPM), and FiveThirtyEight's Robust Algorithm (using) Player Tracking (and) On/Off Ratings (RAPTOR)​. We aim to model and extract feature importance scores for such parameters based on how well they predict MVP rankings, then test our findings against unseen data for the most recent five seasons to see if we can correctly predict the MVP rankings.​ We will experiment with various machine learning approaches and compare our best results to other methods developed by reputable analyst sources.

## Data
<a name="data"></a>

We obtained the dataset from [JK-Future](https://github.com/JK-Future-GitHub/NBA_MVP), who originally scraped the data from Basketball-Reference via automated HTML parsing. The dataset contains statistics for National Basketball Association (NBA) players relevant to determining the Most Valuable Player (MVP) in a season and has 7,329 entries with 53 columns. The dataset is significant in its breadth and depth of coverage.

We store the dataset in [mvp_data.csv](https://github.com/WD-Scott/DS5110_Project/blob/main/Data%20Files/mvp_data.csv) and load it into [DataCleaning_EDA.ipynb](https://github.com/UVA-MLSys/Big-Data-Systems/blob/main/Team%207/Jupyter%20Notebooks/DataCleaning_EDA.ipynb), where we perform data cleaning and aggregation.

<details>
<summary><strong>Click here for details about how we cleaned the data</strong></summary>

* Fill missing values for the Rank, mvp_share, and Trp Dbl (Triple Double) columns
* Normalize the Trp Dbl column by dividing it by G (the total number of games played in a given season)
* Convert G (Games) and Season columns to integer data type
* Filter the entire data frame `(df)` to include only players that meet the 40-game requirement necessary to be considered for the MVP award
* Create the Rk_Conf (Conference Ranking) column – calculate conference rankings for each season based on W (the number of wins), then re-rank the conference rankings within each season and conference group
* Save the edited data frame thus far to [mvp_data_edit.csv](https://github.com/UVA-MLSys/Big-Data-Systems/blob/main/Team%207/Data%20Files/mvp_data_edit.csv) (we use this in [Test.ipynb](https://github.com/UVA-MLSys/Big-Data-Systems/blob/main/Team%207/Jupyter%20Notebooks/Test.ipynb) to merge predicted values with actual and compare results)
* Drop the Conference and W (Wins) columns
* Create a separate data frame `(df_last)` with the data for the most recent five seasons (2018–22), which we use to test our final model and index
* Check for missing values: We found many missing values for seasons before 1980; for example, 3P (Three-pointers) were not introduced in the NBA until 1979–80, and there are a lot of missing values before then, so we drop any season before 1980
* Save `df` and `df_last` to comma-separated Excel files
</details>

We discuss additional preprocessing steps in the Experimental Design section below, as these steps relate to the project's feature selection and modeling phases.

The values we seek to predict are in the mvp_share column, representing each season's MVP voting result.

#### Feature Selection Process
<a name="feature-selection-process"></a>

In [FeatureSelection.ipynb](https://github.com/UVA-MLSys/Big-Data-Systems/blob/main/Team%207/Jupyter%20Notebooks/FeatureSelection.ipynb), we load in [df_clean.csv](https://github.com/UVA-MLSys/Big-Data-Systems/blob/main/Team%207/Data%20Files/df_clean.csv) as a Pandas DataFrame `(df)` and perform robust feature selection using the `preprocess_and_train` function from [preptrain.py](https://github.com/UVA-MLSys/Big-Data-Systems/blob/main/Team%207/Python%20Modules/preptrain.py). The `preprocess_and_train` function serves to:

* Impute missing values with the median value for numeric features, scale the features using standardization (subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation) and apply one-hot encoding for categorical features.

* Apply the preprocessing separately to the training and testing datasets and extract the feature names, removing any prefixes.

* Train and test eight different models on the preprocessed data and extract the feature importance scores of the top ten predictors. The models are:

  - Random Forest (RF)
  - Decision Tree (DTree)
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
  - Gradient Boosting (GB)
  - Support Vector (SVR)
  - Extra Trees (XTrees)
  - AdaBoost (Ada)
  - Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB)

For hyperparameter tuning, we define a reasonably extensive parameter grid for each method and use Bayesian optimization with five-fold cross-validation to sample parameter settings from the specified distributions.

We set the `n_jobs` parameter to $-1$ in the [BayesSearchCV](https://scikit-optimize.github.io/stable/modules/generated/skopt.BayesSearchCV.html) initialization, instructing `scikit-learn` to use all available CPU cores during cross-validation. Thus, each fold's training and evaluation are executed concurrently on different CPU cores, reducing the overall time taken for cross-validation. This parallelization strategy helps to decrease the overall time required for cross-validation, which is particularly beneficial for speeding up the hyperparameter search process.

After running the `preprocess_and_train` function, we use the `print_dict_imps` function from [helper_functions.py](https://github.com/UVA-MLSys/Big-Data-Systems/blob/main/Team%207/Python%20Modules/helper_functions.py) to print tables of the feature importances for each method, which the `preprocess_and_train` function stores in a Python dictionary. We then use the `avg_imp` function from [helper_functions.py](https://github.com/UVA-MLSys/Big-Data-Systems/blob/main/Team%207/Python%20Modules/helper_functions.py) to display the average feature importance across the eight methods. 

Please refer to the Results section below to see the results of the feature selection process.

#### Modeling
<a name="modeling"></a>

In [Models.ipynb](https://github.com/UVA-MLSys/Big-Data-Systems/blob/main/Team%207/Jupyter%20Notebooks/Models.ipynb), we use the `train_models` function from [modeling.py](https://github.com/UVA-MLSys/Big-Data-Systems/blob/main/Team%207/Python%20Modules/modeling.py) to train and test only the ensemble and tree-based methods, as these are best suited for our next task — finding the best model we can and using the feature importance scores to inform our index design.

In [Test.ipynb](https://github.com/UVA-MLSys/Big-Data-Systems/blob/main/Team%207/Jupyter%20Notebooks/Test.ipynb), we load in the selected features, the training dataset, the testing dataset containing the data for the 2018–22 seasons, and the best model from [Models.ipynb](https://github.com/UVA-MLSys/Big-Data-Systems/blob/main/Team%207/Jupyter%20Notebooks/Models.ipynb). We filter the training and testing data to include only the selected features.

We then call the `evaluate_model` function from [helper_functions.py](https://github.com/UVA-MLSys/Big-Data-Systems/blob/main/Team%207/Python%20Modules/helper_functions.py) to retrain the best model and predict the mvp_share for the 2018–22 seasons. We then compare the predicted values to the actual values.

The Results section below discusses the results from our feature selection and modeling processes, and the Testing section contains results from testing our best model and index.

### Results
<a name="results"></a>

The feature selection process originally produced a set of ten highly correlated features, the most correlated of which relate to scoring, as displayed below in the correlation heatmap:

<h1 align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/UVA-MLSys/Big-Data-Systems/blob/main/Team%207/images/corr_scoring.png">
</h1>
<p align="center">

Points (PTS) captures all of these, for the most part, so we drop FTA, FGA, FG, 2P, and FT. We also dropped weight, as it only appeared once.

Moving to the next-highest features in terms of importance, we get:

1. MP
2. PTS
3. PER
4. VORP
5. WS
6. TOV
7. FG%
8. STL%
9. BPM
10. Rk_Conf

FG% is also highly correlated with PTS, so we also drop that. This brings in BPM, which is highly correlated with OBPM, so we drop the latter in favor of the former since it captures both OBPM and DBPM. In replacing FG%, we now look at the next candidate features, DWS and OWS, which are correlated with WS, so we do not include those. The next option is Rk_Year, which is highly correlated with Rk_Conf and likely captures more than just conference ranking, so we include Rk_Year instead of Rk_Conf. Finally, we get AST%. So, our final set of ten features are:

1. MP = Minutes Played
2. PTS = Points
3. PER = Player Efficiency Rating (see <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/per.html">Calculating PER</a> for the formula)
4. VORP = Value Over Replacement Player
5. WS = Win Shares (see <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/ws.html">NBA Win Shares)</a> for information about how this feature is calculated)
6. TOV = Turnovers
7. STL% = Steal percentage
8. BPM = Box Plus-Minus
9. Rk_Year = Team Ranking
10. AST% = Assist percentage

There are still some highly correlated features, but we proceeded with these ten and saved them to [df_selected.csv](https://github.com/UVA-MLSys/Big-Data-Systems/blob/main/Team%207/Data%20Files/df_selected.csv) to use for modeling.

<h1 align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/UVA-MLSys/Big-Data-Systems/blob/main/Team%207/images/corr_final.png">
</h1>
<p align="center">

We feed these ten features into the `train_models` function, which returns several key pieces of information, including the best model. The `train_models` function also displays neat tables of the feature importance values from each model and a model performance bar chart, as displayed below:

<h1 align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/UVA-MLSys/Big-Data-Systems/blob/main/Team%207/images/model_comp.png">
</h1>
<p align="center">

The chart shows that the best model is the Extra Trees Regressor (XTrees), which the `train_models` function saves to `best_model.pkl` using the `joblib` library.

### Testing
<a name="testing"></a>

We import the best model into [Test.ipynb](https://github.com/UVA-MLSys/Big-Data-Systems/blob/main/Team%207/Jupyter%20Notebooks/Test.ipynb) to perform testing on the unseen data.

The chart below displays the predicted values from the best model compared to the actual values; the orange markers represent the predicted value, and the dark blue markers represent the actual value:

<h1 align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/UVA-MLSys/Big-Data-Systems/blob/main/Team%207/images/pred_act.png">
</h1>
<p align="center">

The range plot shows that the predicted values for mvp_share are not wildly off for the top four candidates for the 2018–22 seasons. There are some player-year combinations (Damian Lillard, 2018; Nikola Jokic, 2019; and James Harden, 2020) for which the predicted value is very close to the actual.

The table below shows whether the model correctly predicted the top four rankings for the 2018–22 seasons; the model accurately predicts which players are in the top four each season but doesn't always order them correctly. 

<h1 align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/UVA-MLSys/Big-Data-Systems/blob/main/Team%207/images/table_ranks.png">
</h1>
<p align="center">

The model accurately predicts the MVP for each of the five seasons in the test set. The predictions for the 2018 season were perfect in terms of ranking, but the model's rankings for the next four seasons are slightly off. The rankings for 1st and 2nd for the 2019 season are correct, but the model swaps the 3rd and 4th place candidates. For the 2020 season, the model correctly ranks the 1st and 4th place candidates but swaps 2nd and 3rd place. The model correctly ranks the 1st and 2nd place candidates for the 2021 season but places 3rd and 4th out of order. For the 2022 season, the model incorrectly ranks the 2nd and 3rd place candidates but correctly ranks 1st and 4th.

### Visualization

After obtaining the ten most important features in determining the MVP, the next steps were to predict each player's share and index value for a given year. The share and index metrics were easily plottable as singular quantified values, and we appended them to the larger data set to eventually be imported into AWS QuickSight. QuickSight allows us to select features to appear for a given data point when it is hovered over. The charts make it easy to distinguish how players rank, and the interactive features give the user a better sense of what the player did not attain their relative rank. We can also see a breakdown of a player's ten selected features. This is useful for comparing the Top 5 finishers by our created metric and the actual voting results. Below, you can see an example of the 2022 analysis.

### Conclusions
<a name="conclusions"></a>

The initial feature selection and index calculating model performs well at predicting the 1st-place winner of the award but struggles to predict the runner-ups. This is likely because no distribution is associated with receiving a certain number of runner-up votes in the model. When 100 media members vote on who should win the award, they rank their top 5, with each player receiving points based on how many 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th placed votes they receive. The following is how many points each place vote is worth:

- 1st = 10
- 2nd = 7
- 3rd = 5
- 4th = 3
- 5th = 1

The player with the most aggregate points wins. This point distribution demonstrates why the model can predict 1st place but can't allocate a point total for the remaining four places. For future enhancements, the model should predict a complete voting distribution for at least the top 10 players in consideration for the award.

The criteria for MVP voting have changed over time, meaning any advanced metric used to predict who should win the award will constantly need to be adjusted and taken with a grain of salt. For example, if we look at the most recent MVP race of the 2022–23 season, Joel Embiid won the award over Nikola Jokic even though almost every other advanced aggregate stat (i.e., WS, VORP, and RAPTOR) favored Jokic. There are a few notable reasons for this, the primary two being voter fatigue and narrative. Voter fatigue refers to how media voters avoid picking the same player to win the award many consecutive times, even if they are the most deserving. Having won two straight years, Jokic may have been hampered by this bias from voters while going for his third consecutive award. As for narrative, this is where the crux of our project lies. 

Our goal, along with that of FiveThirtyEight and other data science organizations, was to add objectivity to an inherently subjective topic. Voting is subjective and can be skewed by unaccountable bias and narrative. Along with voter fatigue, media members thought about an era in which Giannis Antetokounmpo, Nikola Jokic, and Joel Embiid constantly placed in the top 5 for voting, yet Embiid never ended up being one of the winners. The narrative of "Jokic or Giannis win again" didn't sit too well in NBA discourse, so naturally, journalists would prefer to have something new to write about. Of course, we don't know every voter's thought process, so all we can do is play with the data and try our best to reach an objective conclusion.
