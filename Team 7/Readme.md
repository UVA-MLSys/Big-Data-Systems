## Introduction

Data Scientists and analysts have developed several metrics for determining a player's value to their team's success. Prominent examples include Value Over Replacement Player (VORP), Box Plus/Minus (BPM), and FiveThirtyEight's Robust Algorithm (using) Player Tracking (and) On/Off Ratings (RAPTOR)​. We aim to develop a multivariate index that weighs these parameters based on how well they predict MVP rankings, then test it on unseen data for the most recent five seasons to see if our "MVP index" correctly predicts the MVP rankings.​ We will experiment with the index formula and compare it to other methods developed by reputable analyst sources.

## Data

We obtained the dataset from [JK-Future](https://github.com/JK-Future-GitHub/NBA_MVP), who originally scraped the data from Basketball-Reference via automated HTML parsing. The dataset contains statistics for National Basketball Association (NBA) players relevant to determining the Most Valuable Player (MVP) in a season and has 7,329 entries with 53 columns. The dataset is significant in its breadth and depth of coverage.

We store the dataset in [mvp_data.csv](https://github.com/WD-Scott/DS5110_Project/blob/main/Data%20Files/mvp_data.csv) and load it into [DataCleaning_EDA.ipynb](https://github.com/UVA-MLSys/Big-Data-Systems/blob/main/Team%207/Jupyter%20Notebooks/DataCleaning_EDA.ipynb), where we perform data cleaning and aggregation.

<details>
<summary><strong>Click here for details about how we cleaned the data</strong></summary>

* Fill missing values for the Rank, mvp_share, and Trp Dbl (Triple Double) columns
* Normalize the Trp Dbl column by dividing it by G (the total number of games played in a given season)
* Convert G (Games) and Season columns to integer data type
* Filter the entire data frame `(df)` to include only players that meet the 40-game requirement necessary to be considered for the MVP award
* Create the Rk_Conf (Conference Ranking) column – calculate conference rankings for each season based on W (the number of wins), then re-rank the conference rankings within each season and conference group
* Save the edited data frame thus far to [mvp_data_edit.csv](https://github.com/UVA-MLSys/Big-Data-Systems/blob/main/Team%207/Data%20Files/mvp_data_edit.csv) (we use this in [Test.ipynb](https://github.com/UVA-MLSys/Big-Data-Systems/blob/main/Team%207/Jupyter%20Notebooks/Test.ipynb) to merge predicted values with actual and compare results)
* Drop the Conference and W (Wins) columns
* Create a separate data frame `(df_last)` with the data for the most recent five seasons (2018–22), which we use to test our final model and index
* Check for missing values: We found many missing values for seasons before 1980; for example, 3P (Three-pointers) were not introduced in the NBA until 1979–80, and there are a lot of missing values before then, so we drop any season before 1980
* Save `df` and `df_last` to comma-separated Excel files
</details>

We discuss additional preprocessing steps in the Experimental Design section below, as these steps relate to the project's feature selection and modeling phases.

The values we seek to predict are in the mvp_share column, which represents the MVP voting result for each season.

#### Design Overview

Below is an overview of the steps to gather the index values and model results. We detail these steps further in the Feature Selection Process, Modeling, Results, and Testing sections that follow.

#### Feature Selection Process

In [FeatureSelection.ipynb](https://github.com/UVA-MLSys/Big-Data-Systems/blob/main/Team%207/Jupyter%20Notebooks/FeatureSelection.ipynb), we load in [df_clean.csv](https://github.com/UVA-MLSys/Big-Data-Systems/blob/main/Team%207/Data%20Files/df_clean.csv) as a Pandas DataFrame `(df)` and perform robust feature selection using the `preprocess_and_train` function from [preptrain.py](https://github.com/UVA-MLSys/Big-Data-Systems/blob/main/Team%207/Python%20Modules/preptrain.py). The `preprocess_and_train` function serves to:

* Impute missing values with the median value for numeric features, scale the features using standardization (subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation) and apply one-hot encoding for categorical features.

* Apply the preprocessing separately to the training and testing datasets and extract the feature names, removing any prefixes.

* Train and test eight different models on the preprocessed data and extract the feature importance scores of the top ten predictors. The models are:

  - Random Forest (RF)
  - Decision Tree (DTree)
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
  - Gradient Boosting (GB)
  - Support Vector (SVR)
  - Extra Trees (XTrees)
  - AdaBoost (Ada)
  - Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB)

For hyperparameter tuning, we define a reasonably extensive parameter grid for each method and use Bayesian optimization with five-fold cross-validation to sample parameter settings from the specified distributions.

We set the `n_jobs` parameter to $-1$ in the `BayesSearchCV` initialization, instructing `scikit-learn` to use all available CPU cores during cross-validation. Thus, each fold's training and evaluation are executed concurrently on different CPU cores, reducing the overall time taken for cross-validation. This parallelization strategy helps to decrease the overall time required for cross-validation, which is particularly beneficial for speeding up the hyperparameter search process.

After running the `preprocess_and_train` function, we use the `print_dict_imps` function from [helper_functions.py](https://github.com/UVA-MLSys/Big-Data-Systems/blob/main/Team%207/Python%20Modules/helper_functions.py) to print tables of the feature importances for each method, which the `preprocess_and_train` function stores in a Python dictionary. We then use the `avg_imp` function from [helper_functions.py](https://github.com/UVA-MLSys/Big-Data-Systems/blob/main/Team%207/Python%20Modules/helper_functions.py) to display the average feature importance across the eight methods. 

The results for the top 10 features included several highly correlated features related to points (scoring), including FT (free throws), 2P (two-pointers), FG (field goals), FGA (field goal attempts), FTA (free throw attempts), and PTS (points).

We chose to drop all of these except PTS because the latter effectively captures the others. The resulting top ten features are:

- WS/48 = Win Shares per 48
- MP = Minutes Played
- PTS = Points
- WS = Win Shares (see <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/ws.html">NBA Win Shares</a>)
- VORP = Value Over Replacement Player
- PER = Player Efficiency Rating (see <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/per.html">Calculating PER</a>)
- eFG% = Effective Field Goal Percentage
- AST = Assists
- Rk_Year = Team Ranking
- DBPM = Defensive Box Plus-Minus

There are still some highly correlated features, but we proceed with these ten and save them to [df_selected.csv](https://github.com/UVA-MLSys/Big-Data-Systems/blob/main/Team%207/Data%20Files/df_selected.csv) to use for modeling.

#### Modeling

In [Models.ipynb](https://github.com/UVA-MLSys/Big-Data-Systems/blob/main/Team%207/Jupyter%20Notebooks/Models.ipynb), we use the `train_models` function from [modeling.py](https://github.com/UVA-MLSys/Big-Data-Systems/blob/main/Team%207/Python%20Modules/modeling.py) to train and test only the ensemble and tree-based methods, as these are best suited for our next task — finding the best model we can and using the feature importance scores to inform our index design.

In [Test.ipynb](https://github.com/UVA-MLSys/Big-Data-Systems/blob/main/Team%207/Jupyter%20Notebooks/Test.ipynb), we load in the selected features, the training dataset, the testing dataset containing the data for the 2018–22 seasons, and the best model from [Models.ipynb](https://github.com/UVA-MLSys/Big-Data-Systems/blob/main/Team%207/Jupyter%20Notebooks/Models.ipynb). We filter the training and testing data to include only the selected features.

We then perform an 80-20 train/test split of the training data and test the best model. Next, we use the best model to predict the mvp_share for the 2018–22 seasons and compare the predicted values to the actual values.

The Results and Testing sections below discuss the modeling results.

### Results

The feature selection process originally produced a set of ten highly correlated features, the most correlated of which are related to scoring, as displayed below in the correlation heatmap:

</h1>
<p align="center">

As previously mentioned, we dropped FT (free throws), 2P (two-pointers), FG (field goals), FGA (field goal attempts), FTA (free throw attempts), and retained PTS (points).

Now, the top ten features include those displayed in the correlation heatmap below:
